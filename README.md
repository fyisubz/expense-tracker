# Expense Tracker

We developed a comprehensive **Expense Tracker** application using Python with SQLite database, Tkinter GUI, and advanced data analytics for efficient personal finance management.

• On the **backend**, we created an expense tracking system with SQLite for CRUD operations, budget tracking, and financial analysis.

• We integrated sample data and implemented core functionalities: adding, updating, deleting, and viewing expenses with budget management and analysis reports.

• On the **frontend**, we built a **Tkinter GUI** with interactive charts using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Seaborn** for beautiful visualizations.
